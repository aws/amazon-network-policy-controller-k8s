## Amazon Network Policy Controller for Kubernetes

Kubernetes controller for NetworkPolicy resources for the [Amazon VPC CNI](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/).

This controller resolves the pod addresses for the configured network policies and publishes them via the CustomResourceDefinition `policyendpoints.networking.k8s.aws` for the VPC CNI node agent to consume.

üìù EKS Customers do not need to install this controller. Review the instructions in the [EKS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cni-network-policy.html). EKS installs and manages it automatically. This cluster is for self managed clusters, such as [kops](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io) clusters.

## Getting Started

The controller image is published to AWS ECR.
The directory `config/default` contains a default configuration for deploying the controller. 

The controller does not require any IAM policies. It does not make AWS API calls.
